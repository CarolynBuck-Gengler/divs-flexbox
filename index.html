                <p>During the pandemic, one thing our family has really gotten into
                    is bicycling. It started in March when we just tried to go for a walk
                    everyday, for exercise and to take a break. We started with short walks but 
                    soon built it up to an hour. When the weather got warm enough, we swapped our 
                    walking shoes for our bicycles, because we could go so much farther! Now
                    we get in 4-5  hour-long rides each week, trying to get to different parts of our city;
                    on Sundays we go nearly 2 hours. We always go early in the morning to avoid the 
                    heat later in the day.</p>                
            </div>
            <div class="div-2">
                <p>Another thing I've taken up during this time is baking, especially bread.
                    I was never a bread baker before, but I found recipes that didn't require 
                    kneading, and bake the bread in my Dutch oven. I've been working with one main recipe,
                    trying to perfect my execution of it, and then branching out with greater proportions
                    of whole wheat flour, and even adding herbs and seeds. I'm also trying other
                    recipes such as a dill-cottage cheese bread, and a honey whole wheat bread. I even 
                    got myself a new smaller Dutch oven. It seems like a lot of people are doing this, because 
                    some ingredients (e.g. flour and yeast) have been hard to find; I still haven't been able
                    to get vital wheat gluten.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="div-3">
                <p>Lastly, in the evenings we've been binging a lot of movies and TV shows we missed
                    in the past. We got Disney+ and CBS All Access to see The Mandelorian, Clone Wars,
                    Picard, Star Trek: Discovery, and Star Trek: Enterprise; and a couple weeks ago
                    were thrilled to be able to watch Hamilton. We also watched several of the Andrew Lloyd
                    Weber musicals when they were aired, and even some ballet versions of Romeo and Juliet.
